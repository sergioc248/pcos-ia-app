## Applicaton: 
My app is about diagnosing PCOS (polyquistic ovary syndrome) with only 5 variables: age, bmi, testosterone levels, antral follicle count and if the user presents menstrual irregularities.
The app should have a welcome screen and a screen that allows the user to input the variables and predict. Depending on the outcome, positive if the user has PCOS, negative if not; the screen should reflect the prediction and give recommendations to the user based on it.

The diagnosis prediction is handled by an ec2 server I have spun up that can predict the diagnosis on #serverip/predict with a form-data with the variables attached.
There is no auth

## Theme:
This app is about a health subject, so it should try to maintain an elegant and health industry theme.
The app should also try to be as modern and sleek as possible on it's UI and UX.
